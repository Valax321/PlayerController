# Player Controller System

The player controller system in this package is a fairly complete player controller implementation built on top of Unity's built-in Character Controller. It contains the basic set of features seen in many first person games, such as jumping, crouching, sprinting and sliding on steep slopes.

To learn more, see [the documentation pages](Documentation~/Introduction.md).

## Installation

The controller is available as a Unity package.
